![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b659da62-07a5-4313-98cd-0c1158b4aca0)

### Project Objectives: 
Develop a steganography application to securely hide text messages inside image files.
Implement encryption and decryption with a passcode for secure access.
Provide a user-friendly GUI using Tkinter.
Ensure that the message is embedded efficiently without distorting the image.

### Files:
- __main.py:__ Contains the complete GUI and logic for image encryption and decryption.
- __README.md:__ Documentation of the project.
- __Images used for Logo and to perform steganography:__ Stores sample images for testing (optional).
- __.exe__ : Stores the .exe files of the code.

### Installation:
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

- __Clone the repository:__ <br>


         git clone https://github.com/Shaikh-Aiman/Secure-Data-Hiding-in-Image-Using-Steganography.git


- __Navigate to the project directory:__
cd Secure-Data-Hiding-in-Image-Using-Steganography
- __Ensure you have Python installed on your system.__
- __Install the required dependencies.__
- __Run the application:__
python stego.py
- __Alternatively, use the provided .exe file for a direct run without dependencies.__
  
### Working:
__Encrypting an Image__
- Select an image file.
- Enter the secret message and passcode.
- Click __"Encrypt Image"__ - A new encrypted image is saved.
  <br>


  
__Decrypting an Image__
- Select the encrypted image.
- Enter the correct passcode.
- Click __"Decrypt Image"__  The hidden message is displayed.

### Conclusion:
This project demonstrates steganography techniques using Python to securely hide messages inside images without visible distortion. The implemented GUI provides a user-friendly interface for both encryption and decryption, ensuring that only authorized users with the correct passcode can retrieve the hidden message. Additionally, the standalone executable (.exe) file makes the application accessible without requiring Python installation, making it a convenient and efficient solution for secure data hiding.
